B | For incoming traffic, to make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, such a URI path or host headers.
C | To better handle instantaneous high loads, such as the start of a product launch event.
D | To ensure requests made from users are securely handled and served.
E | To provide better performance and improved user experience for end users.

<p>
  
Choice| Answer
------------ | -------------  
 C | To better handle instantaneous high loads, such as the start of a product launch event. 
 E | To provide better performance and improved user experience for end users.
 
  
A CDN keeps a recent copy of your web application and can deliver this much faster to users close to an endpoint. CDNs can handle a LOT more data than a typical web server, which makes it ideal to handle traffic spikes as well. CDNs don't generally handle individual traffic routing rules nor security.

# Question 124

Which benefits does adding a load balancer provide? Choose 3

Choice | Answer
------------ | -------------
A. | A load balancer ensures that the load is evenly distributed between 2-5 Virtual Machines.
B. | To ensure only healthy servers process requests.
C. | A load balancer can log traffic that passes through it.
D. | When a Virtual disk is running out of space on a Virtual Machine the incoming data can be directed to another Virtual Machine to manage the load.
E. | When there is too much incoming network traffic for a single VM to handle, a load balancer can distribute the load to many VMs.


<details><summary>See Answer</summary>
<p>
  
Choice| Answer
------------ | -------------  
 B. | To ensure only healthy servers process requests.
 C. | A load balancer can log traffic that passes through it. 
 E. | When there is too much incoming network traffic for a single VM to handle, a load balancer can distribute the load to many VMs.
 
A load balancer sits in front of two or more Virtual Machines to manage, and balance, the load to the Virtual Machines. This can be based on amount of incoming traffic or specific properties in the traffic. A load balancer has nothing to do with Virtual disks, and the max number of VMs to manage goes up to 1000. A load balancer ensures only healthy instances receive traffic and will stop sending traffic to any server that does not pass health checks. All ELB types can log traffic that passes through them

<details><summary>See Answer</summary>
<p>
  
Choice| Answer
------------ | -------------  
 A. | An address space is a range of IP addresses that can be assigned to resources attached to the Virtual Network.
  
 
An address space on a Virtual Network is a number of IP addresses that are unique only on the specific Virtual Network. These IP addresses are assigned to resources connected to the VNet, which allows the resources to interact and communicate. There is no limit to the number or VNets you can have, nor to the number of address spaces.

 A. | For incoming traffic, to make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, such as URI path or host headers.
 E. | If traffic with specific properties needs to be processed by a particular VM.
 
 An application gateway is similar to a load balancer, but can redirect traffic based on attributes in the HTTP request, the request coming in from the internet. You can have a VM handling video, one handling images and so on. Application Gateways do not handle traffic security, nor manage any Virtual Networks.

<details><summary>See Answer</summary>
<p>
  
Choice| Answer
------------ | -------------  
 C. | A virtual network for FinServer and another virtual network for all the other server
  
 Azure virtual networks are similar to LANS on your on-premises network. The idea behind an Azure virtual network is that you create a network. based on a single private IP adress space, on which you can place all your Azure virtual machines. The private IP adress spaces available are in the class A (10.0.0.0/8), Class B (172.16.0.0/12), and Class C (192.168.0.0/16) ranges. Best practice: Create network acces controls between subnets. Routing between subnets happens automatically, and you don't need to manually configure routing tables. By default, there are no network acces controls between the subnets that you create on an Azure Virtual network. Detail: Use a network security group to protect against unsolicited traffic into Azure subnets. Network Security Groups are simple stateful packet inspection devices that use the 5-tuple approach (source IP, source port, destination port, and layer 4 protocol) to create allow/deny rules for network traffic. You allow or deny traffic to and from a single IP adress, to and from multiple IP addresses, or to and from entire subnets. When you use network security groups for network acces control between subnets, you can put the resources that belong to the same security zone or role in their own subnets.
