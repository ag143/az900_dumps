You need to identify the type of failure for which an Azure Availability Zone can be used to protect access to Azure services.
What should you identify?

Statement | Answer
------------ | -------------
A. | a physical server failure
B. | an Azure region failure
C. | a storage failure
D. | an Azure data center failure



<details><summary>See Answer</summary>
<p>
  
 Answer | Explanation
------------ | -------------  
D. an Azure data center failure | Availability zones expand the level of control you have to maintain the availability of the applications and data on your VMs. An Availability Zone is a physically separate zone, within an Azure region. There are three Availability Zones per supported Azure region. Each Availability Zone has a distinct power source, network, and cooling. By architecting your solutions to use replicated VMs in zones, you can protect your apps and data from the loss of a datacenter. If one zone is compromised, then replicated apps and data are instantly available in another zone.

# Question 52 (Describe Cloud Concepts)

You plan to extend your company's network to Azure. The network contains a VPN appliance that uses an IP address of 131.107.200.1.
You need to create an Azure resource that defines the VPN appliance in Azure.
Which Azure resource should you create? To answer, select the appropriate resource in the answer area.

Statement | Answer
------------ | -------------
A. | NAT gateways
B. | Application gateways
C. | Local Network gateways
D. | Virtual Network gateways
E. | On-premises Data Gateways
F. | Azure Data Box Gateway
G. | Azure Stack Edge/Data Box Gateway
H. | Web Application Firewall policies


<details><summary>See Answer</summary>
<p>
  
 Answer | Explanation 
------------ | -------------  
C.  Local Network gateways | A Local Network Gateway is an object in Azure that represents your on-premise VPN device. A Virtual Network Gateway is the VPN object at the Azure end of the VPN. A connection is what connects the Local Network Gateway and the Virtual Network Gateway to bring up the VPN. The local network gateway typically refers to your on-premises location. You give the site a name by which Azure can refer to it, then specify the IP address of the on-premises VPN device to which you will create a connection. You also specify the IP address prefixes that will be routed through the VPN gateway to the VPN device. The address prefixes you specify are the prefixes located on your on-premises network. If your on-premises network changes or you need to change the public IP address for the VPN device, you can easily update the values later.

# Question 53 (Describe Cloud Concepts)

You plan to deploy several Azure virtual machines.
You need to ensure that the services running on the virtual machines are available if a single data center fails.
Solution: You deploy the virtual machines to two or more resource groups.
Does this meet the goal?

Statement | Answer
------------ | -------------
A. | Yes
B. | No


<details><summary>See Answer</summary>
<p>
  
 Answer | Explanation
------------ | -------------  
B. No | A resource group is a logical container for Azure resources. When you create a resource group, you specify which location to create the resource group in. However, when you create a virtual machine and place it in the resource group, the virtual machine can still be in a different location (different datacenter). Therefore, creating multiple resource groups, even if they are in separate datacenters does not ensure that the services running on the virtual machines are available if a single data center fails.

# Question 54 (Describe Cloud Concepts)

You plan to deploy several Azure virtual machines.
You need to ensure that the services running on the virtual machines are available if a single data center fails.
Solution: You deploy the virtual machines to a scale set.
Does this meet the goal?


Statement | Answer
------------ | -------------
A. | Yes
B. | No


<details><summary>See Answer</summary>
<p>
  
 Answer | Explanation
------------ | -------------  
B. No | This answer does not specify that the scale set will be configured across multiple data centers so this solution does not meet the goal. Azure virtual machine scale sets let you create and manage a group of load balanced VMs. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule. Scale sets provide high availability to your applications, and allow you to centrally manage, configure, and update many VMs. Virtual machines in a scale set can be deployed across multiple update domains and fault domains to maximize availability and resilience to outages due to data center outages, and planned or unplanned maintenance events.

Azure Active Directory preview programs
Azure Active Directory provides updates and new features in the form of preview programs. Microsoft rolls out previews in phases to give Microsoft and customers the opportunity to evaluate and understand the new feature before it becomes part of the standard service of Azure AD. The phases are as follows:

- Private preview
  During this phase we invite a few customers to take part in early access to new concepts and features. This phase does not include formal support.
- Public preview
  During this phase we allow any customer with the proper Azure AD license to evaluate the new feature. Microsoft Customer Support Services will supply support services during     this phase, but normal service level agreements do not apply. For new features exposed in the Azure AD Portal, customer can expect to see information banners in the user         interface that draw attention to the new experience available during the preview. By clicking on the information banner customers then opt-in to the preview experience.
- Generally available (GA)
  After the public preview is completed, the feature is open for any licensed customer to use and is supported via all Microsoft support channels. Be aware when a new feature       impacts existing functionality, it might change the way you or your users use the functionality.
  Every Azure Active Directory preview program has different opt-in requirements and dependencies.

A. | Azure Resource Manager Locks
B. | Azure role-based acces control
C. | Azure Policy
D. | Azure Active Directory

<details><summary>See Answer</summary>

------------ | -------------  
 A. | Azure Resource Manager Locks
  
 Lock resources to prevent unexpected changes 
  
 As an administrator, you can lock a subscription, resource group, or resource to prevent other users in your organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources. The lock overrides any permissions the user might have.

You can set the lock level to CanNotDelete or ReadOnly. In the portal, the locks are called Delete and Read-only respectively.

CanNotDelete means authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they can't delete the resource.
ReadOnly means authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resource. Applying this lock is similar to restricting all authorized users to the permissions granted by the Reader role.
Unlike role-based access control, you use management locks to apply a restriction across all users and roles.

# Question 73 (Describe core solutions and management tools on Azure)

Let us suppose you work for ABC Ltd. which has several business units. Each business unit requires 20 different Azure resources for daily operation. All the business units require the same type of Azure resources. Now, you are required to suggest a solution to automate the creation of Azure resources.

Which of the following options would you suggest in this case?

A. | Virtual machine scale sets
B. | The Azure API Management service
C. | Management groups
D. | Azure Resource Manager templates

<details><summary>See Answer</summary>
<p>
  
Choice| Answer
------------ | -------------  
 D. | Azure Resource Manager templates
  
  
With the move to the cloud, many teams have adopted agile development methods. These teams iterate quickly. They need to repeatedly deploy their solutions to the cloud, and know their infrastructure is in a reliable state. As infrastructure has become part of the iterative process, the division between operations and development has disappeared. Teams need to manage infrastructure and application code through a unified process.

To meet these challenges, you can automate deployments and use the practice of infrastructure as code. In code, you define the infrastructure that needs to be deployed. The infrastructure code becomes part of your project. Just like application code, you store the infrastructure code in a source repository and version it. Any one on your team can run the code and deploy similar environments.

To implement infrastructure as code for your Azure solutions, use Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates). The template is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. The template uses declarative syntax, which lets you state what you intend to deploy without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it. In the template, you specify the resources to deploy and the properties for those resources.

We've introduced a new language named Bicep that's used to develop ARM template JSON. Bicep files and JSON templates offer the same capabilities. You can convert templates between the two languages. Bicep provides a syntax that's easier to use for creating templates. For more information, see What is Bicep?.
